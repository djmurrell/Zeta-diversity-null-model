# Zeta-diversity-null-model
The R code in this repository was used to generate null model communities from the data in Britton et al. (2017) Terrestrial-focused protected areas are effective for conservation of freshwater fish diversity in Lake Tanganyika. Biological Conservation (in press). 

The aim is to test if it is possible to generate zeta diversity relationships observed in the unprotected communities from the protected communities.
